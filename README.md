### @jujuadams

Library to interface with reddit's REST API. Uses reddit's standard authorisation flow. Beyond faffing around with reddit's API, this codebase could be used to implement an account system for your game.

More details here: https://www.reddit.com/dev/api

**N.B. You will need to provide your own reddit OAuth credentials.**

Information on how to do this can be found here: https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2
